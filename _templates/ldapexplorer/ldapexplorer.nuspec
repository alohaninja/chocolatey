    <summary>The LDAP Explorer is a small utility written in .Net (using c#) that allows you to navigate a LDAP Directory.
 
It has been tested on Active Directory (win2000 and win2003), Novell E-Directory and OpenLDAP 2.X directory server.  It should also work on other Directory Servers.
 
This utility is very useful when writing application/website that use Active Directory or LDAP as you can navigate the directory and inspect properties of any object in the tree.</summary>
