    <summary>Welcome to the Stramit SharePoint Caml Viewer

I write this tool to help me in writing CAML Query.

Perhaps, you're notice that some CAML is autogenerated each time you're create a view in a list.

My idea is to create some light view in SharePoint, get its CAML code, modify it and paste it into my code

I made the first version for 2003

Here the 2007 version !</summary>
